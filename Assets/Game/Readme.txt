Under this Folder I expect to divide folders in terms of "Layers" or "Modules" as we discussed previously e.g Onion Design.
for example: Character, EventSystem, Generation, Camera, etc.

BTW, there are greats thought about organizing things in Unity project (and not only in Unity, it's good example in general)
This is a link to folder on Google Drive where you can find videos.

Small spoiler, no need to create Scripts folder as a root of Game. But there still a lot more useful things. Please take a read.

Little note: I suggest to use -System suffix for modules witch name might contains classes with the same name 
e.g Character class in Character module. And the problem is that when we would like to put those classes under namespace,
then there would be a conflict.
